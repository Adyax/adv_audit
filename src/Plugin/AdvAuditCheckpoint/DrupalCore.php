An important part of maintaining a Drupal site is in keeping the site updated with the latest security updates released for Drupal core. Drupal is a very secure platform however this does not mean that a snapshot of the platform from a given point in time is free from all imaginable security loopholes. When a security vulnerability is identified by the community or the Drupal Security Team it will be taken care of promptly with the involvement of the Drupal Security Team and patches and a new security release of Drupal core is released within a very short period of time from the time the vulnerability is identified. Once the new security update for the module or Drupal core is released it would be the responsibility of each Drupal site owner (development team) to keep their site updated. A general recommendation is to update the site with all the security updates as soon as the security updates are released.';
