  description: "<p>By default Drupal stores its cache in the database which, depending on the size of the database and amount of visitors, can increase the load on the database server. Currently, there are a lot of reads from cache, most cache data is serialized objects with size about 1mb per object. It is a good practice to remove cache from the database to in-memory storage (reading from memory is always faster than from the disk). Standard solution for in-memory cache storage in Drupal is Memcached, it is recommended to install and use the module.</p>\r\n"
