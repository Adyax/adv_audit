Lets imagine you had to update a single module because of the critical security flaw in it. However, as you haven't updated it for a while, as well as other modules in a project, a maintainer introduced a few API changes since then. So now, when you apply the security update, you will immediately face the compatibility problem.</p>\r\n"
